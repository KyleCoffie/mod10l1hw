// Understanding Data Types in JavaScript
// Objective: The objective of this assignment is to help students grasp the concept of data types in JavaScript and practice working with different types of data.

// Problem Statement: Imagine you are developing a student management system for a school. Your task is to create a JavaScript program that declares variables to store information about students, such as their names, ages, grades, and attendance status.

// Task 1: Declare variables to represent student information such as name, age, grade, and attendance status.

// Task 2: Assign sample values to the student information variables.

// // Task 2: Assign sample values
// studentName = "Alice";
// studentAge = 15;
// studentGrade = 10;
// isPresent = true;

// Task 3: Display the student information using console.log() statements.

// Expected Outcomes:

// After completing Task 1, students should understand how to declare variables with different data types in JavaScript.
// After completing Task 2, students should be able to assign values to variables of various data types.
// After completing Task 3, students should be able to display variable values using console.log() statements.
